# Bounds Shrinker Software

# Inspiration
The purpose of the Bounds Shrinker Software is to reduce the bounds on the variables of an objective function until they form a box which approximates the feasible region(s) formed by the functional constraints and the variable bounds. This software will use a variety of algorithms to achieve the objective, operating both independently and collectively.  

# How we built it
Bounds Shrinker Software program is implemented using the Julia programming language and AMPL.
